# Password-Strength-Tester
ðŸš¨ Your Account Is Hacked! ðŸš¨
Your account is compromised because of a weak password. This is a reality far too common in todayâ€™s digital world. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I wanted to tackle this growing issue and help people create stronger, more secure passwords.

I built a Password Strength Tester that not only evaluates passwords and provides real-time feedback but also includes a powerful new feature:
ðŸŒŸ Automatically Converts Weak Passwords into Strong Ones!

ðŸ’¡ New Feature Highlight: When a password is identified as weak, the tool automatically modifies it into a strong, secure version making security effortless and accessible for all.                                            

Using Python and Tkinter, this tool visually indicates password strength (weak, moderate, strong) with color-coded feedback to guide users toward better security practices.
